-- handle file path relative instead of absolute(it cause a problem for refactoring)

where can the field call happened in other files?

1. in class variables
2. in constructor
3. in methods parameter
4. in method body

current issues:
handling interfaces if the methode implement interfaces do somthing
handling inheritance : Similar Methods in Parent/Child Classes:
If there are methods with similar parameters in parent and child classes (in case of inheritance),
the code should handle in these cases correctly.
