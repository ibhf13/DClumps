1. handle Data Clumps Links
   - link is Given {set of Keys}
   - check the common Fields
   - create new class only from the new Common Variable
   - refactor all classes with the same Link
2. store all types in Data_Clumps_List
3. handle file path relative instead of absoulot
4. Command Arguments
5. bug fix new argument value check
6. JSDocs
7. report

where can the field call happened in other files?

1. in class variables
2. in constructor
3. in methods parameter
4. in method body

current issues:
handling interfaces if the methode implement interfaces do somthing
handling inheritance : Similar Methods in Parent/Child Classes:
If there are methods with similar parameters in parent and child classes (in case of inheritance),
the code should handle in these cases correctly.
