1. make more test
2. Refactoring up to user (the method choice)
   for the user choice will be new class created and then refactor it first then the rest of the group
   else should be the least parameter method

3. handle FieldClumps refactoring
4. handle FieldClumps calls

5. handle inheritance
6. handle interfaces
7. handle intersect
8. test Project
9. acceptance Criteria
10. docs
11. unit test

current issues:
handling interfaces if the methode implement interfaces do somthing
handling inheritance : Similar Methods in Parent/Child Classes:
If there are methods with similar parameters in parent and child classes (in case of inheritance),
the code should handle in these cases correctly.
