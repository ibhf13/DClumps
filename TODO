1. solving bugs:
   1. CallExpression Bug in BinaryExpression
   2. Lost nodes in the 2nd iteration 

2. code Optimierung 
- store all types in Data_Clumps_List 
- apply SOC ,DRY , SOLID


3.GUI: Refactoring up to user (the method choice)
   for the user choice will be new class created and then refactor it first then the rest of the group
   else should be the least parameter method

4. handle inheritance (tell the user if the to be refactored DataClumps class is sub class or not)
check if the class is a parent class? then it need to update all children classes too
5. handle interfaces the same

6.JSDocs
7.(optional) unit test

8. report



where can the field call happened in other files?
1. in class variables
2. in constructor
3. in methods parameter
4. in method body



current issues:
handling interfaces if the methode implement interfaces do somthing
handling inheritance : Similar Methods in Parent/Child Classes:
If there are methods with similar parameters in parent and child classes (in case of inheritance),
the code should handle in these cases correctly.
